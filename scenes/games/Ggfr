Converting 2D co-ordinates into 1D index
Once your have your array, converting a 2D co-ordinate such as 3, 4 into the correct index of your 1D array using row-major order using the following formula:

y * width + x
Converting 1D index into 2D co-ordinates 03
The calculation to convert a 1D index into a 2D co-ordinate is fairly straightforward:
0,0 0,1 0,2 0,3
1,0 1,1 1,2 1,3
2,0 2,1 2,2 2,3
2,3
From 2D to 1D:

index = c + (r * width) = 11
or2,6

depending on whether you read from left to right or top to bottom.

From 1D to 2D:
11
c = index % width
r = index / width 
or

x = index / height
y = index % height
